# Cruise ship system design and ocean information processing optimization based on RDK X5
Application Scenarios In the aquaculture sector, this patrol vessel system utilizes a multi-sensor monitoring system to provide real-time tracking of critical parameters including light intensity, meteorological conditions, and water physicochemical indicators. This data supports precise environmental monitoring for both aquaculture operations and scientific research.  Leveraging the intelligent analysis capabilities of large models, the system assists fishermen in optimizing farm management strategies, enhancing breeding yields, and promoting sustainable aquaculture development.  For marine engineering facility maintenance, the patrol vessel employs depth cameras to detect surface defects on offshore aquaculture cages, buoys, and power distribution systems. Any detected anomalies trigger immediate alarm mechanisms while simultaneously capturing on-site photos uploaded to cloud-based alert platforms, enabling efficient maintenance management of marine infrastructure.  In marine fisheries resource protection, the system combines depth cameras with RetinaNet object detection algorithms for real-time video capture of vessels. By establishing multi-dimensional behavioral profiles including fishing operation times, areas, and vessel types, it activates intelligent alerts upon detecting unauthorized activities during non-operational periods. This establishes a digital security barrier against illegal fishing practices, safeguarding marine fishery resources.

 Core Functions (1) Surface Vessel Detection and Marine Infrastructure Defect Monitoring Equipped with high-definition cameras and RetinaNet algorithm, unmanned vessels are paired with HD depth cameras and RetinaNet algorithm to monitor surface vessels.  Marine Infrastructure Defect Monitoring Utilizes EfficientDet algorithm to monitor marine infrastructure, automatically capturing and uploading defect images to cloud platforms for alerts.  (2) OceanGPT Large Model and Prompt Engineering The system employs the Qwen-based OceanGPT-basic-2B model to provide professional insights and responses for aquaculture operations.  Prompt Engineering adopts a &quot;instruction-context-input-output format&quot; framework to define task boundaries and expected response patterns, establishing input paradigms aligned with large language models&#039; cognitive logic.  (3) Multi-dimensional Environmental Monitoring and Data Transmission Integrates multiple sensors including pH, turbidity, and conductivity with a tracking visual system to create a three-dimensional monitoring network covering surface, underwater, and shore-based areas.  Dual-channel data transmission utilizes WiFi/Lora dual-mode communication to ensure real-time data feedback and remote analysis, supporting historical data retrieval. (4) Intelligent Remote Monitoring and Decision Support Multimodal Real-time Observation: Users can view unmanned boat panoramic videos and environmental parameters in real time via mobile devices, combined with dynamic annotation and early warnings from AI large models.  Data-driven Intelligent Management: Based on historical and real-time data, it generates fish growth trends and health assessments, predicts fish population status, and assists in adjusting breeding strategies
